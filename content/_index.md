<p> HACA is the UK’s leading analytics event for health and care, bringing together analysts, leaders, and decision-makers to connect, learn, and celebrate the impact of great analytical work. The 2025 theme is:
‘Rising to the challenge: Analysis at the heart of health and care systems of the future’

The conference is rooted in our ethos - by analysts, for analysts, with leaders - and showcases how analysis is central to better decisions in health and care.

HACA 2025 will offer two packed days of inspiration, collaboration, and practical insights. You’ll hear from outstanding speakers, see real-world work in action, and take part in sessions designed to strengthen and empower the analytical community.

HACA 2025 is brought to you by the Strategy Unit, with sponsorship from The Health Foundation and supported by organisations from across the UK health and care system.Your text goes here. You can add more content as needed.</p>
