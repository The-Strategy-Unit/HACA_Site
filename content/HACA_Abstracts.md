    <h1>Abstract Submissions- Now Closed</h1>
    <p>Thank you to everyone who submitted their work for HACA 2025. We’ve been inspired by the range, quality, and creativity of the abstracts received - a real showcase of the analytical talent across the UK’s health and care system. </p>

<p>The Health and Care Analytics Conference (HACA) is rooted in our ethos — by analysts, for analysts, with leaders — and provides a space to share learning, inspire peers, and spotlight how analysis is shaping the future of health and care.</p>

<p>Our 2025 theme:
<p class="custom-text">Rising to the challenge: Analysis at the heart of health and care systems of the future,

invites work that shows how analytics is tackling the sector’s most pressing challenges and opportunities. 

We welcomed submissions from public and third sector colleagues across four focus areas: 
<ul>
  <li>Shift from hospital to community</li>
  <li>Improving system flow and reducing waste</li>
  <li>Targeting care and investment for better impact and value</li>
  <li>Advancing analysis and professional development</li>
</ul>

<p>You can still explore the full abstract guidance document here:

We also welcome abstracts that fall outside these categories but still reflect the creativity, rigour, and impact that analysts bring to health and care.

<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>Even though submissions are now closed, you can still:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn from the inspiring talks and sessions in December 2025</li>
<li>View selected abstracts and posters through the online conference platform once registered [Going live soon!]</li>
